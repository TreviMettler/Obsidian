## tools

Tools are things that change your state of mind in real time by taking an unpleasant experience and turning it into an opportunity 

It should change my mood and give me a sense of hope that things wont feel this way forever

~Its a real time visualisation exercise~

Its also a bridge to the cause of the problem to the solution or at least some control

## life.force
If you dont know what to do in life or have no direction you can always work on your life force by activating it

### Body
The bottom is your relationship with your body, by getting your body working i  can help improve my life force by 85%

Examples of working my body are:
	Exercising
	Dieting
	Sleeping

### People
the second level is my relationship to other people
when i get depressed i dont cut of relationship but i drift off into the horizon
relationships are hand holds to keep pulling myself in to life

i cant expect people to reach out cause it isnt gonna happen, i need to be the one to reach out, it *really doesnt* matter who/where but just going out/to someone will help

### Myself
This is my relationship with my unconscious 
i can enchance this relationship by writing (or typing in this case), it acts a mirror and allows things that you didnt know you knew to come out, kind of like giving (him/it/me?) a voice

---

if Im lost i should focus on my life force first, i should be passionate about connecting with my life force and it will lead my to find something im passionate about

## part.X
part X is the judgemental part of me, the anti-social part of me
it wants to keep me from evolving, stop me from changing or getting better
it basically wants to fuck up my ship

~but why~
	to stay where i am cause im comfortable?
	because change is scary?
	because i done wanna fail?
	because im lazy?

it will tell me that what ever i need to do is impossible and i need to give up

part X will never leave *permanently* but it/he? can be subdued 

	!if part X could be killed then i wouldn 18:40
