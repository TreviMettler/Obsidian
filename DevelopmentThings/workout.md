[2/5] Choosing Exercises for your Routine 
Atleast 5-15 rep range

< 5 reps - too difficult 
\> 25+ reps - too easy 

Focus on increasing solid reps for pushups, pullups, and dips

[3/5] Routine Structure 
1. Warmup = mobilization and movement 
2. Strength Ramp-Up - easy to harder 
3. Working Sets - compound (simple and select few movements) 
4. Isolation/Conditioning - light band work, high rep
5. Stretching/Cooldown

[4/5] Progressive Overload (train harder than last time)
Harder Skill
Adding reps or sets 
Improve form 

[5/5] Programming Tips

1. High Frequency (6-7 days) 
   lower volume or intensity (3/5/10 difficulty, or following a split i.e. PPL) 

2. Low Frequency (2-3 days) 
   higher volume or intensity (7-8/10 in difficulty, full body workouts)
   
Aim not to be sore before you train


Arbitrary Target Rep Goals
Pushups: 30+
Dips: 15+ 
Pullups: 15+ 
*the more the better*
